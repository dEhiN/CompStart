 # The following needs to be updated merged into this README, and is old information as of 2025-01-30

 The _templates_ directory has a master copy of the _instructions.txt_ file and the _release_notes.md_ file. These are meant to be copied over to each release folder. When these master copies are updated, previous release folders should keep the copies that were created at the time of release. Only future releases should use the updated versions of the two files.
