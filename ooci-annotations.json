    "message": "Will need to decide how to handle the Python CLI tool exe when it's generated. Right now, GeneratePythonTool.ps1 just creates the exe but doesn't copy it over to the relevant directory within the release folder. Since this script, CopyReleaseContent.ps1, will not be responsible for the py-tools folder, it will also probably not handle copying over the exe. However, one of them will probably need to do that. The problem is that currently both scripts are separate so it's not known which script will be run first.",
