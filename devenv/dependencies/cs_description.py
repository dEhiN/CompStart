What is CompStart?

CompStart is a computer startup tool designed to make your life easier.

What does that mean?

Have you ever wished to be able to log into your laptop at work and have all of your programs automatically start up? Or, maybe you are working on some personal project at home and don't want to be reopening the file or program you're using every time you turn on your computer.

With CompStart, you can have any program automatically open when you log in, have your favourite browser open to any website you desire, as well as open any file you want, such as a Word document.
