# CompStart/experimental_content

Parent folder to store any experimental stuff that doesn't really fit another branch, such as a feature branch or an issue branch. For example, while playing around with Tkinter, originally I created a feature branch. However, I was experimenting with Tkinter, not working on an actual feature branch. Therefore, the folder for that code will be in here, under main.

If one wants to continue experimenting, a branch could be created off main to make any changes. The only rule is that each subfolder, or thing being experimented with, should be self-contained and not have any link or bearing on existing project content. That is, while a library, etc. might be experimented with for possible future use and inclusion in a feature branch, until that is decided for sure, any code should existing only in the subdirectory within _experimental_content_.
