# CompStart/experimental_content

Parent folder to hold all any experimental stuff work. The need for this folder came out of the following:

While playing around with the Python library _Tkinter_, originally a feature branch was created. However, the purpose was to experiment with _Tkinter_, not work on an actual feature branch. Therefore, the folder for that code will be in this _experimental_content_ folder.

Each subfolder should represent experimentation with a specific thing and branches should be created off main to track changes. Each subfolder, or thing being experimented with, should be self-contained and not have any link or bearing on existing project content. That is, while a library, etc. might be experimented with for possible future use and inclusion in a feature branch, until that is decided for sure, any code should exist only here.
