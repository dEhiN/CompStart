Comments from issue #5 in Project:

Amalgamating the logic and lists from both previous comments, I think I can safely say the next steps for this issue are:

1. Refactor the function data_validation_scenario to utilize the item_type variable

2. Refactor the function data_validation_scenario to screen for all four scenarios, each of the four values of the item_type variable

3. Refactor the function match_scenario to account for the four scenarios

4. Decide if the function generate_user_edited_data will remove a startup item and update the startup JSON data, or if the calling function is responsible for that

5. Update all calls to generate_user_edited_data to pass in the correct parameters, mainly, that the item_type parameter is now a string

While working on step 1, the ordering, or number assigned, to each scenario may need to change to reflect the if-block in generate_user_edited_data.

While working on steps 1-3, testing revealed that, for the existing scenarios, the calls to generate_user_edited_data causes an error because the calls are still based on when the second parameter was a boolean.

Going with option 3:

- Modify the function generate_user_edited_data so a calling function can pass in a single startup item and specify that it needs to be removed from the existing startup data
- If necessary, update the scenario validation functions data_validation_scenario and match_scenario
- Call the modified generate_user_edited_data function from json_pruner
 - Test that it works

The above are the steps to take to resolve this issue and close the branch dEhiN/issue5.

    Added call to function generate_user_edited_data
    from json_pruner in module jsonfn
    
    Updated function json_pruner to print out the
    item requested to be deleted as well as the rest
    of the items data. Also added a call to the
    function generate_user_edited_data.
    
    However, passing in just the Items array causes
    the JSON data validation to fail. Will need to
    figure out a solution. Possible options are:
    
    1. Modify the generate_user_edited_data
    function to allow for an Items array to be passed
    in.
    
    2. Modify the json_pruner function to pass in
    updated JSON data.
    
    3. Modify a mix of both functions
    to allow for a single startup item to be passed in
    but specified to be removed.
    
    4. Create a new function to take the Items array
    and make a fully formed startup JSON object from
    it.
    
    Most likely, will go with option 3 since the
    generate_user_edited_data is meant to be used for
    all scenarios where the user is editing existing
    startup data. There is already the ability to
    pass in just a single startup item and also to
    specify if that startup item is to be added to the
    existing full startup data or replace an existing
    item. It shouldn't be hard to modify the function
    to allow the startup item to be removed and
    specify that.
