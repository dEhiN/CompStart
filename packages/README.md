# CompStart/packages

Parent folder to store all released packages. The subfolders for each release should have just a single file, for example, either a _zip_ or _msi_ file. This is what will be distributed to GitHub.

## Directory Structure

### Major Versions

Major versions will have a directory that starts with _v_ followed by the version number. For example, _v1_ is for all content related to version 1.

### Minor Versions

Minor versions will have a directory that starts with _m_ followed by the version number. For example, _v1/m1_ would be for all content related to version 1.1.
