# CompStart/packages

Parent folder to store all released packages. The subfolders for each release should have just a single file, for example, either a _zip_ or _msi_ file. This is what will be distributed to GitHub.

## Directory Structure

### Major Versions

Major versions will have a directory that starts with _v_ followed by the version number. For example, _v1_ is for all content related to version 1.

### Minor Versions

Minor versions will have a directory that starts with _m_ followed by the version number. For example, _v1/m1_ would be for all content related to version 1.1.

### Artifacts

Each minor version folder will have one or more archive files that will have the full release version name. For example, the package for release version 1.1 will be named _CompStart-1.1.zip_. If a release has a tag associated with it, that will also be included in the name, such as _CompStart-1.1-alpha.zip_. See the next two sections for more details.
